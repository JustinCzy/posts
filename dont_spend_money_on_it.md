A common trope when arguing for some new government programs is to claim that we should spend money on something in order to show we care for it. Consider the following argument:

* I say that we should be spending a lot more money on the space program
* You say that we should fix more of our problems here on Earth before putting more dollars into space.
* I point out the many useful earthbound technologies that came out of the space program.
* You say that even more development would have been possible with more direct spending. The space program is mainly a diversion.
* I then say that, even if space exploration has not yet generated much value, it works as a sort of "hedge". If Earth becomes uninhabitable, we will need to go elsewhere, and developing this capacity now is a reasonable measure.
* But you say this is so improbable that it's not a reasonable claim on our spending. If every possible risk deserves funding, we'll end up with an absurd list of vanity projects.
* I fall back on the claim that we shouldn't just talk about space exploration for its utilitarian benefits. At the end of the day, exploration is important, it is something that humans have always done. Our eyes see the horizon. Our minds think "What is beyond?" This is part of what it is to be human. The way that we express this is by funding further exploration. That is, because space exploration is important, we should be spending a lot of money on it.
