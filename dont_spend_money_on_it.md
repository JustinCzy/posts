A common trope when arguing for some new government programs is to claim that we should spend money on something in order to show we care for it. Consider the following argument:

* I say that we should be spending a lot more money on the space program
* You say that we should fix more of our problems here on Earth before putting more dollars into space.
* I point out the many useful earthbound technologies that came out of the space program.
* You say that even more development would have been possible with more direct spending. The space program is mainly a diversion.
* I then say that, even if space exploration has not yet generated much value, it works as a sort of "hedge". If Earth becomes uninhabitable, we will need to go elsewhere, and developing this capacity now is a reasonable measure.
* But you say this is so improbable that it's not a reasonable claim on our spending. If every possible risk deserves funding, we'll end up with an absurd list of vanity projects.
* I fall back on the claim that we shouldn't just talk about space exploration for its utilitarian benefits. At the end of the day, exploration is important, it is something that humans have always done. Our eyes see the horizon. Our minds think "What is beyond?" This is part of what it is to be human. The way that we express this is by funding further exploration. That is, because space exploration is important, we should be spending a lot of money on it.

## Getting the Story Backwards
The notion that spending money on something signals it's importance is an error. It is nearly the opposite of the truth. If something is important to you, then you put your effort, your time, your energy, your mindspace into it. For tasks that are not very important, you substitute money for the time it would take you to do it. This may seem like a weird nitpicky way to put things, but we need to be really clear what we mean when we talk about "caring" about something. To care about something is to devote to it.

When someone says that we show we care about space travel by spending money on it, they are not using the commonly understand meaning of the word _care_. You don't show you care about your friends or family by throwing money at them. They are rightly offended if you try. Throwing money at a problem is a way of _offloading_ it. 
* If you don't want to worry about the risk of your house burning down, you buy insurance for this risk. Your money moves some of the problem onto the insurer, who is better able to bear it. 
* If you don't want to drive through rush hour traffic yourself, you take a taxi. You have substituted money for the pain of plodding along the congested road. 
* Most information is now available to anyone, but it's spread out all over the place. If it's too time-intensive to learn something on your own, you can hire a tutor to do the work of aggregating and explaining it to you.

This point is important because a lot of people are making a lot of money by feeding you the lie that spending money on something shows how imprtant it is to you. 
* Paying for a gym membership _feels_ like it has health benefits, but it doesn't. Working out has health benefits, but too many people stop at the satifaction they feel from the first step. It's a false satisfaction.
* Buying books certainly feels better than actually reading them. But the act of buying the book does nothing for you. Booksellers want you to think it does, but they are lying and manipulating you.

## But What about Society?

## Conclusion
I understand that what I'm saying may have very deep implications for what we prioritize. It implies that there are a lot of things wrong with the world as it is.

If what I'm saying implies that ...
If what I'm saying implies that capitalism is fundamentally flawed, then so much the worse for capitalism.
