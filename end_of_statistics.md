# What's to become of the Statisticians?

It's been said that Charles Darwin was the last economist and the first biologist. While it is true that there were some economists after Darwin, they mostly did "cargo-cult-science". After Darwin, there was no sense in economics. The discipline had been superceeded.

We are now, I believe, living in the era of the last statistician. I don't know who it will be, but it is likely someone currently alive. Statistics will continue as a "science" but will no longer be science. It's time is over.

This will of course surprise most people. After all, statistics has apparently never been more successful, with more and more popular books touting "think like an economist" hacks to improve your relationships, health, parenting, and practically anything else. It is important to recognize that this is what a _peak_ looks like. The fact that statistics is becoming the sort of thing we all take for granted is strong evidence that it has run out of room to grow.
