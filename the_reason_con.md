There are more and more people making a living off of a con that boils down to something like this:

> You can't trust your brain to make rational decisions. Here's 17 weird tricks to get yourself to do rational things!

It's packaged in more cerebral language but this is always the gist. It's appealing because it offers something that is not possible. To put it bluntly, the _reason con_ is the notion that irrational humans can, and should, try to be rational. A lot of the people selling this con don't realize it is a con, but it is one. The story it tells is almost exactly backwards.

I don't want to name names here, because the scope is very large. Virtually all the books you'll see on a home page are examples. The reason con has become so common that what surprises us is to see a real work of art. I simply want to describe the thought process of reasoning from irrationality to rationality, and to explain why I think this approach could not be more wrong. I don't think poorly of people caught up in the reason con. Most of them are thoughtful and well-intentioned. Most of my favorite thinkers are caught up in it, as am I. My goal here is rather prophecy: pointing to the future trajectory of things so that people won't make the mistake of going down with the ship. The ship is instrumental rationality, and it's time has ended. It's time to get off of it.
