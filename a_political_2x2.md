# A political 2x2

Conventional wisdom about politics goes something like this:

> People fall into something like a normal distribution in their political preferences. Most people are in the center, with declining numbers as you go out to the extreme right or left.
> However, because people adjust their preferences to match those of people they like, people on the center-left and center-right gravitate toward the positions of political parties. The result is that the normal distribution pulls apart into a bimodal distribution, and this creates greater polarization.

This is a fine way to think about it, but I think it misses a really important axis of attitudes toward politics. In addition to the conventional idea of a right, left, and center, there is a difference between two types that I will call "militants" and "tolerants". Simply put, militants are those who believe that the current situation is intolerable and prioritize changing things. Tolerants are those who believe that the current situation is good or better than alternatives, so prioritize holding on to the good things we have. This distinction is often identified as "progressive" vs. "conservative", but this confuses things. Whether someone is a militant or tolerant derives from their affect toward the current order. But the changes that a militant wants to see may be in a left or a right direction. Likewise, the endowments that a tolerant wants to preserve may be accomplishments of the left or the right. Collapsing attitudes toward change with attitudes toward issues such as the role of government in a citizen's life is confusing.

I will try to describe better what I think the "left" and the "right" want at the end, but that is less important to me. The left and right are different in different countries and eras. But I think that the difference between militants and tolerants is broadly applicable as a useful distinction.

## The 2x2
This is the image I have in mind. 

I'll go into more detail about these differences. For now, I want to emphasize that it is a mistake to think that "left" is the same as "militant". There are people with extremely left ideas who nevertheless oppose radical change because they worry about prohibitive switching costs. There are middle-of-the-road people who think the system is completely broken and in need of replacement. That is to say, where a person sits on the horizontal axis is conceptually independent of where they fall on the vertical one.

In practice, there seems to be a lot of overlap, so that most people would fall on a U-shaped curve. The most militant people are often those with the most extreme beliefs, and the most tolerant are usually more centrist in orientation. But there are enough exceptions that we need to recognize the two as distinct.


## What Militants Want
A militant may be forged by many means. A conventional view would hold something like this:

> People whose convictions fall outside of the mainstream find themselves marginalized. They are pushed off the stage, ignored, or even mocked. This leads them to desparation and resentment, and so they turn to extremism as the only available means of making themselves heard.

I think this is true for a lot of people. However, I think is probably a better explanation in a majority of cases:

> There is a temperament which says that _something_ is wrong in this world. People with this temperament are far more likely to feel that the system is bad and needs to be changed. This conviction makes extreme beliefs more attractive.

To be clear, I think that most militants go through some self-reinforcing process of alienation from the way things are. It is rarely, if ever, just one thing.
