# Optimism Meliorated
I underwent a transformation in my political outlook over time. I am going to tell the story of what happened. I'm not doing so because it is a particularly interesting or special story. Rather, I am telling it because it is so common. I am writing this because people have often told me that I put into words the things they have long known but never been able to express.
