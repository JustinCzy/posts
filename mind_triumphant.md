# The Mind Triumphant

We are living through the endgame of the Enlightenment. This does not mean a return to the so-called Dark Age, but an advance to a new way of thinking and being in the world. The old, Enlightenment concepts are not good enough anymore. It's time to replace them. Some things will be retained, others discarded. Some of the new concepts will in fact be ancient ones. This process is the normal course of things.

One of the concepts to be discarded is anatomical monism. This is the belief that each part of the body has a single and unique function. For example, when it was observed that the function of the heart was to pump blood, monism decreed that only the heart could pump blood, and that the heart could not do anything but pump blood. This belief has led to the well-intentioned but problematic practice of transplanting a person's heart the same way that we replace the fuel injector on a car. While heart transplants are an admirable advance of science, it is a mistake to view them as mundane. To replace a person's heart is, to some extent, to replace that person's spirit. The result is a different person. We ought to accompany this transformation with an appropriate reverence, a recognition of its deeply spiritual significance. There should be some sort of religious ceremony for organ transplants. To do any less is literally obscene.

The greatest beneficiary of the end of anatomical monism will be the mind. It was an injustice to imprison the expansive world of thought inside our puny brains, a flabby ... gram hunk of tissue. This cage could never be sufficient to thought. The mind is so much more than the brain. This was always known, but it became an embarrassing fact, something to which poets and playwrites could allude but which serious conversation must ellide.

This was a mistake. It was not just wrong, it confined our understanding of thinking. It was a mistake to suppose that intellect would be best exercised by isolated practice in tight chairs inside drab classrooms. In many ways this was the worst possible environment to exercise the mind, and it is a wonder any thinking has occurred in spite of it. No wonder so many of the great inventors hated school.

With an expansive understanding of the mind, we see why Aristotle insisted on teaching while walking around. If you want to teach children, do so during recess. Recess is the only time of the schoolday when their minds are truly receptive. This knowledge is starting to break through. It will be common sense in the future, we just have to get through the inevitable pushback of tradition.

A delightful move toward breaking the mind from its prison is the book .... Inevitably, she tries to allign the ideas to the best current science, which makes the message far more muddled than the poetic treatment I'm giving here. But it is directionally correct. Any movement away from the brain-as-thinker to the broader mind-as-thinker is welcome. We don't just think with our whole bodies, even with our hearts. We think with much more than just ourselves.

The modern conception of the mind makes an analogy to a computer. This is a little better than the prior analogy to an engine. But the problem is that the computer they have in mind is still one from the 1950's, a hierarchical mainframe. It would have been better to describe the mind as a network of radio transceivers. In the 21st century, we may as well update the analogy and say that the mind works like the public internet, with much of the traffic flowing through main ..., but with most of the action happening in the .... Like every analogy, this analogy is not perfect (that is what makes it an analogy, after all). But it will serve far better going forward.

There is a case for moderation and compromise in the road to a better understand of the mind. But my purpose here is not to build bridges. I am drawing lines in the sand to be absolutely clear what the implications will be of the changes we are seeing:

* If you believe that each part of the body has a single exclusive function, then you are a dinosaur.
* If you mentally capitalize the word "science" in your head, then you are a dinosaur.
* If your mind ineluctably smirks when it hears the word "mystical", then you are a dinosaur.
* If you think that a "reality-based community" is a plausible response to the rise of the post-truth world, then you are a dinosaur. Incidentally, what they are actually creating is a community-based reality, but unfortunately it is built on a false consciousness.

## The Promiscuous Mind
> the mind has a great propensity to spread itself on external objects, and to conjoin with them any internal impressions, which they occasion.
> David Hume

It is standard practice to present the mind to students as a sort of muddled and slightly senile old man. We talk about all its great past achievements: its impressive capacity to take in new sensations. But then we go on and on about how foolish our minds can be. How they are hopelessly biased, easily confused, and .....
